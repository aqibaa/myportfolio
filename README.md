## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```
    *(**Important:** The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and should never be committed to GitHub.)*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
